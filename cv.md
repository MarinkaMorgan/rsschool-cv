## Objectives:

A few months ago, I created my first page using HTML, CSS, and JS, and I really enjoyed the process and the result. I became more interested in web development, web design and interactive applications. Programming has become my new hobby, which I started to learn in my free time. My goal is to become a web developer and create amazing websites and applications by working in a team and always learning new things.

## Code example:

function formatDay(timestamp) {
let date = new Date(timestamp \* 1000);
let day = date.getDay();
let days = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue",
"Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"];

return days[day];
}
